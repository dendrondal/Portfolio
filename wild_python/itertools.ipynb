    "## About this series\n",
    "This blog post is the first of a new series I'm starting called \"Wild Python,\" aka use cases of selected python libraries in deployment. Posts of this series will generally consist of a breakdown of the library and intended use cases, followed by several examples of how it is used in the context of several popular GitHub repositories. This series will be continually ongoing, partially to act as a personal refresher course.\n",

    "## What is _itertools_?\n",
    "Itertools is Python implementation of a common design pattern to stream data in [functional programming](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/introduction-functional-programming-python/). Effectively, this allows a way to take an iterable (```list, tuple, dict, string``` etc.) and apply a very succinct method to lazily iterate through them based on several commonly used pieces of logic. Let's take a toy example, one of the [most overused interview questions](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/fizzbuzz-in-too-much-detail/):\n"

    "Let's break this down: ```itertools.cycle``` consumes an iterator, then loops back over it from the beginning infinitely, or until a stop condition is reached. As the name implies, this is very useful for cyclic or periodic data. ```count``` is another infinite iterator, that accepts a \"start\" and \"step\" argument, similar to ```range()``` Finally, we have ```islice```, another piece of syntactic sugar that is equivalent to ```for i in range(number): do_something(iterable[i])```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in addition to being more readable, this has the advantage of speed and memory efficiency. The ```for``` loop above using ```range``` would most likely be used with a previously existing iterable, which is stored in RAM. This is opposed to the ```islice``` implementation, which doesn't store any values, only using RAM in the case that it is called. Note that an equivalent alternative to the islice implementation above is to say ```for i in range(16): print(next(fizzbuzz))``` Next is an important method to keep in mind when working with generators.\n",

    "Let's break this down: we have several items with a cost and weight associated with them. There are many data structures that can represent this, but I decided to go with named tuples for clarity's sake (this will probably warrant another Wild Python article). We then iterate through all possible combinations of items by finding combinations of different length within a nested for loop. We add them to a dictionary if it maxes out the knapsack carrying capacity. Finally, we see what the highest value combination is by ordering the resulting dictionary by values rather than keys, then reversing it. We now have a very fast and memory-efficient brute force solution!\n",
